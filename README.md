# Password-Duplicatication

It's a VBS file that if you input the wrong password, it would duplicate 3x. If you give the correct password it will disappear.

It is customizable, if you want to create a custom password, I'd recommend to use the "customize.vbs"

IMPORTANT: USE THIS TO PRANK YOU'RE FRIENDS!

REALLY IMPORTANT: AND ANNOY THEM WITH DUPLICATING BOXES

ACTUALLY THIS IS THE IMPORTANT: Do not move the custom file ANYWHERE, if you want to then create a shortcut file instead or the script will not work
